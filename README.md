# Space Shooter Game
Space Shooter Game is a retro-style 2D shooter where the player controls a spaceship and shoots incoming meteors. This project was developed using Processing during the first year of my university studies.

## Features
- **Spaceship Controls**: Move the spaceship using the arrow keys (left, right, up, down) and shoot lasers with the space bar.
- **Retro-style Sound**: Background music and sound effects for shooting and collisions create an immersive experience.
- **Score and Lives**: Players start with 3 lives and earn points by destroying meteors. Game over occurs when all lives are lost.
- **Random Meteor Generation**: Meteors spawn randomly and increase the challenge over time.

## Game Mechanics
- Control the spaceship using the arrow keys to dodge meteors and press the space bar to shoot.
- Earn points by shooting meteors. Each destroyed meteor gives 10 points.
- The player has 3 lives. Collisions with meteors reduce lives, and when lives reach zero, the game is over.

## Prerequisites
- Processing IDE to run the code file
